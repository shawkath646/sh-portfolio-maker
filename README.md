### Project Type: Web Application

### Description:

**SH Portfolio Maker** offers a comprehensive, complimentary platform designed to craft elegant, structured, and animated portfolios tailored to showcase your professional profile. Sign in effortlessly and begin presenting your work with sophistication and ease.

### Project Duration: December 2023 - April 2024

### Purpose:

As a web developer, I often create projects for practice and production purposes. Many of these projects require a login system for protected data. Creating separate accounts for each project is not efficient and results in poor user management. To address this, I developed the SH Authentication System using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID client support. Now, users can access multiple applications under one account, and I can also save user-customized data. Additionally, other developers can utilize these features by registering their apps.
